                <p>We are the builders of the future.
                    Just as a carpenter has a multitude of tools to sand the wood or cut it, we have our digital tools to
                    build the ideas and dreams of our clients.</p>

                <h2>Academic</h2>
                <p>I've studied Law. However, I did not like the environment or the direction I had set in my life. <br>
                    So I decided to change drastically and start looking for a life elsewhere. <br>
                    At the end of 2022, I will move to Madrid to look for new opportunities.</p>

                <h2>Professional</h2>
                <p>I went through several jobs, as a car buyer, telemarketer and currently I work as a salesman-athlete at
                    Decathlon. <br>
                    Decathlon has taught me passion for work, customer service and self-improvement.

                    My three great passions are video games, reading and sport. <br>
                    I have been playing World of Warcraft since I was a child and I continue to do so today. <br>
                    In reading, I am passionate about fantasy worlds and specifically, the Stormlight Archive. <br>
